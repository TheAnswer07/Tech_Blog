### Project Description:

My challenge with this project is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. I'm building this site completely from scratch and deploying it to Heroku. My app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

### User Story:

AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions

### Features:

Homepage including existing blog posts | Navigation links for the homepage and dashboard | Option to log in | Other links in the navigation | Sign up option/button to create a username and password | Navigation links for the homepage, dashboard, and option to log out | Post title, contents, post creator’s username, date of post creation and option to leave a comment | Button to add a new blog post with option to enter both a title and contents for a blog post | Delete/update post options and redirection back to updated dashboard | Logout option to sign out of the site | If idle on the site for more than a set timelog, feature to log in again before being able to add, update, or delete comments
